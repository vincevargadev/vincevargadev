## Hello

* ðŸ’™&nbsp;&nbsp;  Currently, I'm working with Flutter and Dart. I'd love to see Dart become a popular full-stack language.
* ðŸŽ™&nbsp;&nbsp;  I'm the host of the [Flutter 101 Podcast](https://flutter101.dev/). It's available on [Google Podcasts](https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9lU3labTZKOA%3D%3D), [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/flutter-101-podcast/id1548010659), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1hwHiSz7MODI6lnzvGDS43), [Amazon Music](https://music.amazon.de/podcasts/d7665f8b-4204-4778-83c5-fee33cf0c48d/Flutter-101-Podcast), [RSS](https://feeds.simplecast.com/eSyZm6J8), [on the web, and more](https://flutter101.dev/episodes)
* ðŸ“¦&nbsp;&nbsp;  I develop and maintain various open-source packages. I work on open-source Dart code in my free time and sometimes at work.
* ðŸ—£&nbsp;&nbsp;  I launched and organized the [Flutter meetups in Munich](https://meetup.com/Flutter-Munich/). Due to the coronavirus pandemic, we don't hold events at the moment.
* ðŸ“–&nbsp;&nbsp;  I'm currently learning Vim, Rust, and good software development practices.
* âš›&nbsp;&nbsp;  I studied Physics at the university. I'm a self-taught software developer.
* ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º&nbsp;&nbsp;  As a Hungarian, living and working in Munich, I enjoy learning languages. Just imagine if I didn't! I speak English, Spanish, and German (though the biggest room in the world is the room for improvement)

### Open-source

I developed, published, and maintained various Dart packages and Flutter plugins on the pub.dev platform in my free time and as part of my daily job.

The packages I developed in my free time are published under [`dartside.dev`](https://pub.dev/publishers/dartside.dev/packages). You can also find my other packages that I developed while working at [SMAHO](https://github.com/smaho-engineering/) [here](https://pub.dev/packages?q=smaho).

#### Flutter packages

* [`weekday_selector`](https://pub.dev/packages/weekday_selector): A collection of custom Flutter widgets and classes to help you select weekdays in your apps. Perfect for recurring events, alarms. The weekday selector is customizable, themeable, accessible, and it supports internationalization.
* [`nuts_activity_indicator`](https://pub.dev/packages/nuts_activity_indicator): I took advantage of the fact that the Flutter built-in widgets are open-source: This package is based on the cupertino library's activity indicator offering excellent customizability. You can customize, amongst others, the color, the width, the speed of the spinner, and the number of the rectangles that make up the activity indicator.
* [`xcontext`](https://pub.dev/packages/xcontext): This extension library makes it easy to add static extensions methods and getters to the context from Flutter libraries. It keeps your code clean and concise, with all the type safety guarantees that Dart provides.

#### Flutter plugins

* [`esptouch_flutter`](https://pub.dev/packages/esptouch_flutter): Flutter plugin package, which contains an easy-to-use API for ESP-Touch in Dart. The plugin includes the platform-specific implementation for Android using Java and iOS using Objective-C. The platform code was heavily modified to provide greater customizability to fit SMAHO's internal and customer-facing apps. The plugin is the most popular ESP-Touch plugin for Flutter. ESP-Touch is a protocol developed by Espressif Systems to configure WiFi devices connecting to a router. It's most commonly used in headless systems due to their lack of a user interface.
* [`android_wifi_info`](https://pub.dev/packages/android_wifi_info), [`ios_network_info`](https://pub.dev/packages/ios_network_info): Plugin packages for accessing Android's wifi info and the iOS network info from Flutter.
* [`settings_panel_android`](https://pub.dev/packages/settings_panel_android): Plugin that helps you show Android's settings panels directly from your Dart code. Settings panels are used to change NFC, Volume, and connectivity settings quickly, and they help to reduce churn.

#### Dart packages

* [`mailto`](https://pub.dev/packages/mailto), [`whatsapp_unilink`](https://pub.dev/packages/whatsapp_unilink): Simple Dart packages to build "mailto" links and WhatsApp unilinks, respectively. The packages work with Flutter, web, and backend Dart.

### Flutter Munich

In December 2018, I launched a [Flutter meetup group in Munich](https://meetup.com/Flutter-Munich/). I've been the main organizer of Flutter Munich ever since. The group focuses on Flutter and Dart. After 15+ events, the group has 700+ members, and it has become the largest Flutter meetup group in Germany and one of the largest in Europe.

We organize study jams, Flutter app demos, and hackathons in collaboration with local developers and companies, Googlers, and GDEs. I'm very proud of our hackathon where we developed [app prototypes for people with aphasia](https://github.com/flutter-munich/hackathon). We also collaborated on an [event focussing on cross-platform development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diunwwXgMK4) with the local Android and Kotlin user groups.

I gave [multiple presentations](https://github.com/dartsidedev/presentations) at these events:

* Platform channels in Flutter: Interactions between Flutter and native hosts (iOS and Android).
* Full-stack Dart: Using Dart on the backend, Aqueduct deep-dive.
* Flutter as cross-platform technology: mobile, web, and desktop.
* Develop and publish a custom widget package: the weekday selector.

I started recording and editing some of the talks from the Flutter events and published the videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-ts4XH21boCnblu8YK9TsA). As our "personnel", equipment, and time available for editing were limited, the video quality might not always be perfect, but we've gotten much better over time!

**vargavince91/vargavince91** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Flutter, Dart.
  * Link to open source packages from pub.dev: working on open source in my free time and at SMAHO (weekday selector, ESP-Touch, explain why they are cool, link to pub dev for all the packages)
- Working at SMAHO, link open source GitHub organization
- I was pretty good with JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java one day
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Vim and Go.
- Fun fact: studied physics, living in Germany, likes to (? more like have to) learn languages.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter
- Organizer of Flutter Munich Meetup page, LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, YouTube
- Talks on YouTube: how far back should I go? CUDA?

Where are all the social sites' icons at???
